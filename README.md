# PyProbe by Ben Chung
### An easy to use domain name probe.

## Usage
python3 probe.py [file] [-p] [-h]

[file] Is a file containing the urls which should be probed, you can create such a text file using a program such as Sublist3r or assetfinder.  
[-v] Verbose mode, call this if you want to see the request status come back in real time. This will however make the process slower.  
[-p] Are the ports that you wish to probe, for example if you wished to find FTP servers running on domains, then you would provide -p20,21 to this argument.  
[-h] Prints a help menu and exits.  

Happy Hacking!
