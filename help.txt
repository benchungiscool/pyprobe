PyProbe by Ben Chung
An easy to use domain name probe.

Usage: python3 probe.py [file] [-p] [-h]

[file] Is a file containing the urls which should be probed, you can create such a text file using a program such as Sublist3r or assetfinder.
[-p] Are the ports that you wish to probe, for example if you wished to find FTP servers running on domains, then you would provide -p20,21 to this argument.
[-h] Prints this help menu and exits.

Happy Hacking!
